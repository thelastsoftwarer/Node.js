# Node.js
In this node.js application, the methods related to entering the data of the users, printing to the screen, editing, deleting, and updating are used and saved in the database.
In this application, the frontend is not included in the code and does not have a design. Most of the methods belonging to http are used, which includes only sending it to the database and recording and allowing us to make changes on it.
